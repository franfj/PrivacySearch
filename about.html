	Web search engines use various personalization techniques that lend themselves to, or are based on, the construction of their users' interests and preferences profile. The lack of transparency about what information is stored, how it is used and with whom it is shared, limits the perception of privacy that users have about the search service.
	</p>

	<p style="white-space: normal;">
	Through the generalization of queries, the user profile becomes less precise and therefore more private, although evidently at the expense of a degradation in the accuracy of the search results.
	</p>
	
	<p style="white-space: normal;">
	This add-on	allows users to generalize queries, and send them to a search engine automatically in local mode (without the need of an external database or infrastructure) and in real time, according to simple privacy criteria.
